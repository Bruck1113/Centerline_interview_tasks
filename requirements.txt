Your task is to write a Python script that does the following:

1. Creates a configuration file that contains a nested dictionary structure.
The configuration includes variables such as paths, file names, parameters, and data frames.

2. Reads and parses the configuration file.

3. Concurrently monitors specified directories for the appearance of specific files 
within a given time frame, logging throughout the script.

   If a specified file appears, the script should:

   a. Trigger a system notification.

   b. Record the event (including timestamp and filename) at a designated location.

Requirements:
- Ensure the script is compatible with Windows

- Provide clear documentation on how to set up and run the script, including any configuration
 modifications.

- Implement error handling for file operations and configuration parsing.

- Ensure the script can handle multiple directories and multiple target files simultaneously 
using multi-threading or asynchronous programming.

- The monitoring should be efficient and not consume excessive system resources. 
Explain your optimization strategies.

- Design the script to be easily extendable for future additions of monitored directories
 or file types.
